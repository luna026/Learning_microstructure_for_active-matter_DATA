# Learning_microstructure_code_and_data
This repository contains all data files and codes generated and used for the paper 'Learning Microstructure in Active matter'.

## The data is given for 3 cases: 

- # Passive Brownian particles:
  Contains all the raw simulation files for different packing fractions (as .tar.xz files), Percus-Yevick data for those specific packing fractions (as .tar.xz files), the Jupyter notebook containing the DNN model and all the visualization, and the .py file used to obtain the symbolic regression expression (.pkl file is the obtained model).
  
- # Active Brownian case with isotropy:
  
- # Active Brownian case with anisotropy:
  Contains the raw simulation files (as .tar.xz format), the trained DNN model (.pth format), and the output PySR model (as .pkl file).
