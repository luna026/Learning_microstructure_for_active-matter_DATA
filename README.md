#     Learning_microstructure_for_active-matter_DATA
This repository contains all data files and codes generated and used for the paper 'Learning Microstructure in Active matter'.

## The data is given for 3 cases: 

- # Passive Brownian particles:
  Contains all the raw simulation files for different packing fractions (as .tar.xz files), Percus-Yevick data for those specific packing fractions (as .tar.xz files), the Jupyter notebook containing the DNN model definition and results for the 2D case (as .ipynb file) and 3D case (.ipynb file).
  
- # Active Brownian case with isotropy:
  Contains jupyter notebook with the DNN model definition and visualization of the results, the .py file with the pysr code, and pther necessary additional files (note: which also includes the trained DNN model, pySR model)
  
- # Active Brownian case with anisotropy:
  Contains the raw simulation files (as .tar.xz format), the trained DNN model (.pth format), and the output PySR model (as .pkl file).
